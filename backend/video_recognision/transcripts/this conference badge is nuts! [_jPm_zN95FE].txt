[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000] Now this is a cool conference badge.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.060] This is from GitHub University Developer Conference and the entire badge itself actually
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.060] a printed PCB.
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.740] Look, I pulled one out of the garbage because I'm a monster but it's got a Wi-Fi Bluetooth
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.460] chip on it, little antenna.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.100] It's got a Raspberry Pi 2350 IO out the Wazoo.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.940] Obviously a full color screen and some GPIO pins up top which I'm going to show you how
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.800] I actually use that in just a second.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.140] So the badge itself has a bunch of apps already preloaded on it.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.360] You see there's a Tamagotchi, there's a Etch a sketch on it, there's Flappy Bird which
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.720] is really fun to be able to play and then finally they have a badge itself which if you load
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.080] it up, connect to the Wi-Fi, it goes and fetches all of your GitHub details and displays them
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.640] right on the badge.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.700] So I thought of course we got to be able to figure out how to hack this.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.260] So what I did is at the conference as well they were giving these lights out which is
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.260] a kind of a 3D printed light with some 5V addressable LED pixels and then they have a spot
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.280] where you can put like a ESP32 but I thought we don't need that.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.920] This is a microcontroller in itself and it has a battery.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.660] We got to be able to power it.
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.860] So if you take a look up here there is a, oh I already broke one of my shitty sautters.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.640] I'll have to shatter that back on before I show you but you see we've got 3.3 volt
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.500] and ground down here and then four different GPIO pins on the top.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.820] You can see a little bit better on here.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.220] So what I did is these things here have power ground and a data line which allows you
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.740] to address every single one.
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.660] All right, got them soldered back on and then when you go over to my app that I built,
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.380] I'll show you the code in just a second.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.620] Start that sucker up and boom.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.220] So the badger itself comes with a bunch of utils for doing things like drawing shapes
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.740] on screen and listening for button clicks and button events.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.180] So I made the thing where you can obviously just change the color based on where the cursor
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.180] is.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.500] I did another one where if you click it once it will just push the color that into an
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.660] array and light them up like that.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.300] Of course I had to do rainbow mode.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.220] If I hit it five times one, two, three, four, five, then it moves into rainbow mode and
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.780] then once I get this thing fully hooked up, you can kind of see the effect that you'll
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.180] get is diffuse, beautiful rainbow LEDs.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.420] The code behind this is all written in something called micro python.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.220] So you simply just need to upload some python code to it.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.460] I wrote a little util here to work with addressing the individual LEDs.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.940] Only there's a library on these things called Neo pixel but it wasn't on this one.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.460] So I just kind of wrote the minimum viable one to get me working with that.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.540] And then a bunch of python code for listening for button presses and sending that data out
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.060] to the pixels.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.820] These are all made by a company called Pimmarini and they actually sell a package for these.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.180] They make them for conferences mostly but they sell them if you want to just grab one
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.740] and hack it which I recommend because it's kind of fun to be able to fuss around with
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.660] this stuff, especially with LLMs now.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.200] It allows you to push past if you just a lowly JavaScript programmer who's tinkered in
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.860] hardware, you can sort of push past that and make some some real stuff.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.860] I do have the E ink one from last year which is pretty nifty but this one just blew it
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.220] out of the water and I think it's really cool that this is this is like totally it's not
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.220] plugged into anything.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.300] It's all running on a battery and it's totally connected to Wi-Fi.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.860] So now I'm curious and this is probably a sentence that has never been said before but
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.420] I'm curious if I can hook up my conference badge to a previous project which is my robot
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.260] controlled vacuum cleaner.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.780] Let me know down in the comments below if I should try that.
