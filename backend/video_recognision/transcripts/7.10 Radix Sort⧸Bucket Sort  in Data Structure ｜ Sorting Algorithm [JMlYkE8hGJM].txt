[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.340] Pass anyway is 10th place.

[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.100] after 2 insta flood with data as 8th place
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.160] complete chart as 5th place
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:27.100] hurricanes
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:46.000] 3 2 1 2 2nd bucket 0 1 1 in 1 bucket 8 0 2 0 is there so 8 0 2 here also we have
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:57.280] 0 here we have 2 1 2 3 here we have 1 0 1 5 and here we have 0 1 0 9 these buckets are empty
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.720] right so that's fine now next step is what you are going to remove the data from these buckets
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.360] how from the starting bucket and from starting bucket also if many numbers are there and then we
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.600] are going to remove the first number first right so after pass 2 this is pass 2 so after pass 2 the
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:27.680] data is something like this remove this one 0 0 1 8 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 9 here we have 0 1 0 so after pass
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:35.440] 2 the data is this one now the last pass that is the third pass in that pass we are going to
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.480] sort the data according to which digit the third one this one the digit which is at 100th place
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.880] right so now repeat the same step we are going to take again 10 buckets now this is pass 3 again
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.840] we are going to take 10 buckets ranging from 0 to 9 again we are going to fill these buckets how
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.840] so these are the number after pass 2 so now we are going to see which digit the third one third one
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.520] so now here we have 0 we are we are going to put this in 0th bucket here we have 8
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:22.720] 8 0 2 0 0 0 2 1 0 9 0 1 0 here we have again 0 1 1 0 1 5 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:32.720] so this is 1 here we have 0 0 9 0 right so these are the buckets now now next step is what
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.280] you are going to remove data from these buckets right and remove means you are going to store
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.680] the data in an output array so here is 0 0 once you you can write 1 here we have 2 here we have
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:59.440] 10 11 15 90 10 9 1 2 3 3 2 1 and finally 8 0 2
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:08.560] so this is the data after pass 3 so as you can see this is the sorted data now so here we have
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.320] removed the extra zeros we have put to make the numbers 3 digit number right so this is now the
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.880] sorted data as you can see how many passes you required 3 means the number of digits in the
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.160] maximum number those number of passes would be required here we have 3 digits so 3 passes would
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.720] be required so this is how reddick sort will sort the data see this reddick sort use what count
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:40.240] sort as a subroutine so you know what is the count sort right and if you say the the running
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:50.320] time complexity for this sort is what you can write order of d into n plus b now here see
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:58.640] d is what number of digits in maximum number number of digits are 3 so here for each digit
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.680] we are going to repeat the steps right first of all for this digit then this then this how many
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.920] times three times you have repeated so here we are taking d into n is the number of how many
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:17.040] numbers are there plus b is what base what is base here because we are going to take
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.520] buckets equal to the base here base is 10 so we are going to take 10 buckets in alphabets base is
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:30.880] 26 so in that case we will take 26 buckets from 0 to 25 that is why i am going to take here b n plus
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:38.160] b and d is number of digits so we are going to repeat the steps here for three times the number
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.800] of digits times right so this is the time complexity so this is all about bucket sort or you can say
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.640] this reddick sort in next video we are going to discuss shell sorting so till then bye bye take care
