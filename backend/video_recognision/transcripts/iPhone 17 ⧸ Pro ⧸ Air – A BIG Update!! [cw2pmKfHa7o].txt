[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800] All right, this was a big one.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.520] I think the biggest iPhone event that I've been to,
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.080] they had a lot of new hardware, so phones,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.640] watches, AirPods, plus all the accessories for this stuff.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.560] There were a lot of people at this event,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.120] but I spent as much time as I could with these devices
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.000] before I got kicked out from that space.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.560] I have a lot of thoughts I wanna share.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.200] So first, the phones, we have the iPhone 17,
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.480] the iPhone 17 Pro, the Pro Max,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.440] and the last one arguably the most interesting one to me
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.320] is the iPhone Air.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.320] So there is no more iPhone 17 plus type product.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.520] It's been replaced in spirit by the iPhone Air.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.320] And if you'll notice, there is no numerical moniker to it.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.560] It's not iPhone 17 Air, it's just iPhone Air.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.880] And I'm assuming it's because it's probably not gonna
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.160] replace this every generation, but this product has a big screen,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.680] like I would expect because it's replacing a plus product.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.600] And this is a Pro Motion 120 Hertz screen,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400] but this device is very thin and very light.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.240] It does have a titanium frame and ceramic glass
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.560] to keep it as rigid and as strong as possible.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.240] We'll see how that holds up over time.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.440] But this is a remarkably thin and light iPhone.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.160] It has similar vibes to the S25 Edge product
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.720] that we saw a few months back, but that device,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.800] it's got a very sharp edge,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.720] but it just got very pronounced squareish edges, right?
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.120] The S25 Edge product from Samsung.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.400] But the iPhone Air has rounded edges
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.080] and it feels very different in-hand.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.080] It actually feels much more comfortable to hold.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.600] Not that phone comfort is all that important,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.880] but it is something I noticed right off the rip.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.520] So this device has 12 gigs of RAM
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.240] and the new A19 Pro chip,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.360] so it's got the same kind of hardware specs
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.800] as the top end pro products this year,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.280] but it has a single camera.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.360] It's just the regular wide angle lens.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.000] There is no ultra wide, there is no optical zoom.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.280] It's able to crop that sensor
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.000] for the optical-like telephoto,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.320] but it is a single lens camera.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.280] You also lose the ability to do any kind of spatial videos.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.160] You're like 3D depth videos if you're looking for that.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.680] You lose a lot of versatility
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.560] that basically every single smartphone camera has today.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.600] And it's all in pursuit of thinness.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.240] And the reason why it only has one camera
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.840] is because the entire internal space is mostly battery.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.760] It's only that top section that has the camera components
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760] and the chips.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720] It is a very densely packed device, mostly for battery.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.280] Now this battery is not a physically large battery
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.760] because it is a very thin device
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.120] and it's not silicon carbon like next-gen battery tech
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.040] and you're powering a relatively large screen.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.080] All of these things work against long battery life
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.920] on a device.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.400] And the quoted numbers that they have
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.800] in terms of just the typical battery life testing
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.400] that they do for these devices
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880] is pretty good on paper.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.320] Now if this is any other company,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.520] I would be like, those numbers have to be BS
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.440] because there's no way they're hitting that.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.680] But Apple has a track record,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.880] at least from my testing,
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.480] to be very aligned with what their published numbers are.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.760] So I need to do some proper testing it.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.280] It's not like long battery life,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.960] but it is way longer than I would expect
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.280] considering how thin this devices.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.640] There is a new low profile battery pack.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.680] It's fairly big, it's very flat
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.360] and it's got like a rounded design
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.560] compared to the previous generation
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.400] and also used the USB-C charging.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.280] But this pack, every device that I tried to connect up to it
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.440] did not fit nicely except for the iPhone Air.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.360] So I tried it on 16 Pro Max,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.280] I tried it on a 16.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.120] I even tried it with the new iPhone 17 Pro devices.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.800] It's just not built for anything
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.120] with a normal camera hump.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.960] It just needs that really thin camera hump,
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.440] like the visor shaped thing we see on the iPhone Air.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.200] Everything else did not fit nicely.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.880] There's also a very thin case that Apple makes for this device.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.680] It's only 0.9 millimeter thick,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.880] but when I had this thing on,
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.080] it just changed the shape and feel of this device drastically.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.280] I feel like this phone is going to appeal mostly to people
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.080] that just don't run cases on the device.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.440] The moment you throw a case on it,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.040] regardless of how thin it is,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.240] it just loses most of the appeal of what makes the iPhone Air,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.200] the iPhone Air.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.640] There's also a bumper case for it
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.840] that had pretty stiff rubber compared to what I've seen
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.920] from previous Apple bumper cases.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.520] But again, it just changes the way that's sitting looks and feels.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.920] But overall, it's a very nice looking device,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.400] but it does have a single camera,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.280] it does have a relatively small size battery
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.040] and based on my ears, single speaker.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.200] In terms of color options,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.000] the black iPhone Air is actually the only black looking iPhone
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.280] that they're offering this year in terms of like the new ones.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.920] The blue color is very pale.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.680] It's almost like a cool toned white.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680] The starlight is okay,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680] but the white color to me is my favorite.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.200] Now, all of these devices have that polished titanium rail
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.840] and it does get pretty smudgy.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.920] So the iPhone Air is priced at $1,000,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.960] which if I'm being honest,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.760] it's a little bit cheaper than I thought it would be.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.040] Now that it's a cheap phone,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.760] but considering Apple and the pricing that they have
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.880] for like the Super Thin products,
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.840] it's, I would have expected like a hundred
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.280] or even $200 more.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.760] Now, I think for most people looking at this price tag
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.600] and at this product,
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.720] there's gonna be like two camps.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.320] One group is gonna be like, that's crazy.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.920] $1,000 for a phone that has less features
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.960] and less battery than a normal phone.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.840] What, like who wants this?
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.080] And then the other camp looks at it
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.400] and it's like, that is a very nice and elegant
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.920] and almost just different looking iPhone
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.480] for whatever reason that's appealing.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.480] For me personally, I did not think
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.080] that this would appeal to me the way that it does.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.520] I think the way that holds and the way that it feels,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.640] just the idea of a Super Thin and Light phone is awesome.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.200] I think I value like a good camera
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.320] and a good battery way too much.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.320] So we'll see in the proper testing,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.200] but it's a very interesting phone.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.560] Now in terms of phones that have big batteries,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.880] the Pro devices have the big batteries
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.040] and they're extra big this year.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.240] Now if you pick up a pro phone like right after holding
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.600] the iPhone Air, it is so weird.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.960] It's almost like these are like big back iPhones.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.120] They feel fat and it's because of the shape,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.520] they are actually a little bit bigger
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.640] than the iPhone 16 Pro devices
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.960] and these have rounded corners,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.480] but really when you pick these things up,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.840] they actually feel like pudgy or like just bloated in comparison.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.880] It's a unibody aluminum design this year.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.600] There's no titanium, so it's milled out
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.240] from a single block of aluminum.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.240] And because of that, the back panel has no seams.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.560] Like the back panel is just part of the same material block
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.760] as the rail.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.600] There is a piece of ceramic shield on the back
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.840] to allow for wireless charging
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.440] and to give it that kind of frosted glass texture.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.240] It runs the new A19 Pro chip
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.800] and it does have 12 gigs of RAM,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.000] so I'm sure when I do any kind of performance testing,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.720] bigger numbers equals better.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.640] But it also has a vapor chamber.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.680] And it's very interesting to me that they went with vapor chamber
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.760] to cool a phone before they did any of their laptops.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.880] Like even when they had their overheating MacBooks
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.240] with Intel chips, they had regular heat sinks.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.040] But on this phone, vapor chamber and an aluminum build.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.760] Like I enjoy good thermals on all of my devices,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.400] but how hard are these iPhone Pro's really supposed to get?
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.400] That is a very aggressive and capable thermal system
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.240] on a phone.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.640] Now the camera system on the Pro devices,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.000] all three cameras are 48 megapixel now.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.080] The telephoto now also goes up to 8x zoom.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.720] It's an optical like zoom though.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.200] So it's a sensor crop again.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.520] I did test it out real briefly,
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.080] but I'm gonna reserve my judgment for the proper review.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.280] The images do look good though
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.160] and having extra zoom capabilities is always nice.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.040] The colors are limited this year.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.600] There is no black color.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.680] There is a dark blue and it does look nice,
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.640] but if you someone that just needs to have a black phone,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.560] it doesn't exist.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.000] The orange color, it's really cool to look at.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.600] And when you just like pick it up on your phone
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.200] and playing with it, it's very cool.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.280] I don't know if I want to own something that is so loud.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.320] It's got a very similar orange color
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.480] to the orange you see on like the Apple Watch Ultra devices.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.960] It's like that really bright,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.920] almost like emergency orange.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.480] There's also lighter color options.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.960] I like the white with its kind of natural silver color.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.640] Last but not least, the regular iPhone 17.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.720] So the biggest change for the regular iPhone 17
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.520] is the inclusion finally of a 120Hz promotion panel.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.360] It's finally here.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.960] So it's only the iPhone 16E
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.240] that doesn't have a promotion panel at this point.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.560] It has eight gigs of RAM and it uses an A19 chips.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.400] I'm not the pro chip.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.960] So everything is just a little bit kind of tuned down
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.800] in terms of performance, but 120Hz panel.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.160] And a significantly bigger battery.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.520] Now the rear camera is still arranged vertically.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.160] Though ultra wide has a 48 megapixel sensor.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.640] So it's just more capable,
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.800] but I'll test that in the future review.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.080] Now the front facing camera for all four of these devices
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.280] have a new square sensor that allows you to change
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.040] the aspect ratio and zoom in and out a little bit
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.360] with just a button tap.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.640] You don't need to rotate the phone
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.000] to be able to go into landscape.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.280] And also because it's got that big sensor,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.920] it's able to do the center stage stuff
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.720] that we've seen on the MacBooks and the iPads.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.600] It's just a way more versatile front facing camera
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.440] than before.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.160] The pricing on the bass model is the same
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.680] as the previous generation, but it now has more storage
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.520] at that base.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.120] It's now 256 gigs, which I think is a good,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.240] nice thing all things considered.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.840] Okay, the AirPods Pro 3.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.040] So these were very impressive to me.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.560] I put these in and I couldn't really get a gauge
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.240] of the actual sound quality because it was very noise environment.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.400] But when the noise cancellation kicked in, my God,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.920] it was so much more capable than the APP2.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.560] I switched them in and out because I brought my AirPods Pro 2
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.560] and it's very distinct as to how much more just powerful
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.720] the noise cancellation is on APP3.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.120] They claimed 2x, I believe it.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.320] And if that's something you were looking for
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.480] and you always thought that APP2 was not strong enough,
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.760] these are legit.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.920] Now, the other than that was interesting are the tips.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.240] So these now use a, what they describe as foam-infused
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.040] silicon.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.040] And at first I thought it'd be like a comply foam tip,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.520] where you like squish them in and stick them in here.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.360] It's not that.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.280] It actually feels very much like silicone still.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.120] It's just a squishier silicone.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.400] And when you put it in your ear, it does feel different.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.560] So the buds themselves sit out a little bit further
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.760] of your ear than the old ones did.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.760] The new tips though do not work with older generations
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.680] of AirPods Pro, unfortunately.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.560] It's just unique to the AirPods Pro 3.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.240] And it does have a heart rate sensor,
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.880] which I imagine for most people that care about fitness,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.480] like they already have some kind of fitness tracker
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480] that does it.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.800] There are some cases where having it in the bud
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.680] is just a better, like if you use machines
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800] that you wanna be able to transmit it.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.640] You don't wanna wear watches.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.040] There's like various cases, but I think for most people,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.680] the heart rate sensor is just gonna be like a redundant feature.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.560] And nice to have, but they didn't jack up the price
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.480] on the thing, it's still 249.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.440] Last thing real quick, Apple watches.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.200] So watch Ultra 3 has a slightly bigger screen
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.160] than before, like the bezel on the edge is a little bit thinner.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.160] But the most interesting thing to me is the new capability
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.320] for the heart rate sensors to be able to get a read
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.320] on blood pressure.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.160] So it's not meant to be like,
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.520] hey, what's my blood pressure?
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.360] Check it.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.960] I don't even think it's capable of doing that.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.160] What this thing does do is that it monitors
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160] your blood pressure over time, and after a 30 day window,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.360] if you potentially have chronic hypertension,
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.880] it will tell you that is something
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.400] that is so important for people to know.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.880] So a lot of people are completely unaware of the fact
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.160] that they do have elevated blood pressure.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.880] And it's something that if you have that condition
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.480] over an extended period of time,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.120] it will absolutely affect your health.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.040] So having this built into a watch
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.720] that millions of people have is awesome.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.040] Like absolutely awesome.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.120] We don't know how accurate this stuff really is,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.120] and I think it's still waiting for approval.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.200] But the idea of it is very well done.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.760] Now this is not the first time we've seen this.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.160] Samsung has blood pressure capabilities on their watches,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.600] but they do need a secondary device
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600] but to calibrate that thing regularly.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.120] And it's just not something that a lot of people
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.280] are willing and capable of doing.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.960] But on the Apple Watch,
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.360] if it works the way that it's intended
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.800] and the way they're marketing it,
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.680] I think it'll be very useful for just average human health.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.160] I think it's really, really cool.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.120] Okay, this has been a very long video.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.120] Hope you guys enjoyed it.
