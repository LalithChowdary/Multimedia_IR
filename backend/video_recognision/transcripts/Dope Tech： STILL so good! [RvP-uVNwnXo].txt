[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680] Alright, welcome back to Dope Tech.
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.280] It has been too long.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.640] It's been more than a year since the last Dope Tech video, but I love this series.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.920] I've made more than 30 of them.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.000] I've shown off more than 100 products in various ways through Dope Tech, and I just feel
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.640] like we should be getting back to this.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.240] So something I've noticed while we were heads down in busy season and all the smartphones
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.240] and all the brand new stuff, is there are a couple things that I missed during this year,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.480] but those things were often successors to previous gadgets that I've also already
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.600] talked about on this channel, things that I've had in Dope Tech before.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.240] So this is Dope Tech Revisited.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.400] Everything that I'm showing in this Dope Tech is a follow up to something that I have
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.280] previously showed some older version of Undoak Tech in the past.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.560] So we can see if it's still dope, if it's gotten better since it came out or worse,
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.840] and how it measures up.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.120] Also thanks to Google for sponsoring a portion of this video, more on that later.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.000] So first up, the Goated Productivity Mouse, the Logitech MX Master.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.680] Now I've personally been using the MX Master since the first one, and actually even before
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.880] that when it was called the Performance MX, but it first appeared in Dope Tech six years
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.720] ago as the MX Master 3 with a bunch of other stuff, but it was actually the most replayed
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.480] part of that video.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.520] Next then they've also come out with MX Master 3S, and then this is MX Master 4.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.520] So the benefit of having such a popular mouse is Logitech basically gets tons of data on
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.080] how we use our mice, the things we like about it, the things we don't like about it, and
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.800] then they can make iterative improvements over and over again on each one.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.600] And so this one, the four, I've noticed has some bigger changes, but still keeps that formula
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.200] and feels familiar.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.480] So it's still a great size, still a great shape for Rides anyway.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.560] You know, a lot of older MX masters, you might see end up looking kind of crummy after
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.920] a few years because of the rubberized finish that they all have.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.080] Well, Logitech, notice that.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.520] So this one should avoid all that because it's an entirely new plastic finish.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.120] Now obviously plastic has a negative connotation, but in certain products it just makes sense,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.280] like headphones and computer mice.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880] So there's no finish to wear off.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.240] It's just texture, it's lightweight, it's recycled, and the little micro texture they've
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.760] put on this middle part gives you a little bit of extra grip.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.440] So I'm pumped that it should have a much longer life of looking, basically new, but then
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.880] there's also a whole bunch of other little things.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.760] Like the horizontal scroll wheel is moved a bit higher up, which is awesome for me because
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.080] I use it all the time while video editing.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.440] The mouse click is also now with the last two generations super silent, which is nice
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.640] in a studio environment like this.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.160] There's also a third button added up at the front here in front of the forward and back
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.800] buttons that can be customized.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.400] And then the biggest new addition is actually haptics.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.160] And so that's kind of a bold thing to try.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.600] Obviously you have mouse clicks already, but they've added a haptic motor for even more
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600] clicks.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.880] It's in the middle of the mouse kind of like right by your thumb, kind of like a smart
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.160] phone's vibration motor.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.440] So when you press this silicon gesture area down here, you can feel it click.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.840] Even though it's not actually moving, it's a very convincing click, and then you can turn
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.840] that up or down in settings, along with tons of other stuff like setting that to be a quick
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.760] launch shortcut ring for any of your favorite apps or spaces or emission control on a
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.120] Mac or you can even make your own macros.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.120] So the Logitech Options Plus app is just a fantasy land level of playground for people
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.480] trying to maximize their productivity.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.840] It's kind of like this little grand theft auto weapon select, but for your computer mouse.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.280] I personally don't use a ton of these like quick launching features because I am a keyboard
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.200] and Raycast shortcut person on the Mac anyway, but I can see people would love this.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.080] I feel like this is becoming like the portion 9.11 of computer mice.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.240] Maybe like hear me out.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.120] This is not changing very much from generation to generation.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.240] It keeps the same silhouette, the iconic shape that everyone knows.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.280] But each time they improve a little bit and iterate over and over to the nth degree.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.840] And it's the most important product for that company.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.760] So they don't want to change it too much.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.280] But also it's just like the ideal enthusiast daily driver.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.920] And it's still expensive and doesn't have the best numbers on paper.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.160] Like this is still a $120 computer mouse with a 120 Hertz polling rate where like there
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.040] are mice out there with a thousand Hertz, two thousand, eight thousand Hertz polling
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.240] rates.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240] But it's not a gaming mouse.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.080] It's just a rock solid pricey but ideal daily.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.640] It's about the most stable, reliable thing you can ask for and it even now has a USB type
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.640] C dongle which I'm shocked we actually don't see more of.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.160] So yeah, this mouse is absolutely still dope tech.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.160] Alright, next up is a YouTube legend in its own right.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.360] This is the new Devilay Phantom.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.480] So I feel like there is a whole era of a couple months on YouTube where a thumbnail with
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.080] the Phantom in it was like an automatic million views and everybody had to check this thing
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.080] out.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.120] I've actually already covered it twice on dope tech first in the white and gold version.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.160] Then the Phantom 2 which was smaller but a bit more reasonably priced so it was a natural
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.120] follow up to the expensive first one and now they come out with this which is the Devilay
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.200] Phantom Ultimate.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.480] And so there's two sizes of it.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.600] There's a smaller 98 decibel version and then there's this which is the bigger louder,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.160] more powerful 108 decibel version.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.200] So the idea has not changed at all.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.680] It's an all in one speaker system with a tweeter and woofers that not only gets crazy
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.580] loud and sounds really good but it also has this big dramatic moving membrane for the
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.800] woofers and kind of looks like an alien head if you ask me.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.280] They're definitely a conversation starter but there are also new drivers and a new internal
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.640] circuitry to make them more efficient and continue to sound even better.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.600] But yeah, this is the larger 108 decibel version here and on this stand which is kind of
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.960] the best way to get it close to head level.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960] They're pretty awesome.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.600] They're kind of more dense actually than you would expect.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.320] Picking up each one, it's almost 25 pounds.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.640] But yeah, but apparently this is the amount of space you'll need to deliver 108 decibels
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.480] versus this significantly smaller 98 decibel version.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.920] And there's also a new app that lets you play with more modes and even pair two together
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.800] in stereo mode which is what I have over here by the TV.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.760] There's another one over on the other side and two of them paired together is just crazy.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.720] They get ridiculously loud if you want them to but also just in normal volume, they sound
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720] really good.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.920] There's an incredible amount of bass.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.240] It fills the room, whatever size room you're in, it's going to fill the room.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.840] And the stereo separation now, if having a left-right channel with these things, it's
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840] mad.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.840] It sounds crazy.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.160] And fun fact, I now mostly see these in Newark Airport.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.240] I think it's the older version but next time you're in Newark Airport, look up in the
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.640] corners of the little kiosks and the tiny stores they have in between gates.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.920] And I guarantee you'll start seeing tons of these little speakers from Devilay and you'll
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.720] never be able to unsee them again.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.520] At least if you're like me and spend probably too much time in Newark Airport.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.000] Anyway, cool overall obviously but not a ton of change, still very expensive and not
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.680] as hype as they used to be.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:21.920] So I covered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus in 2020 and it was the third highest viewed
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.360] dope tech episode that we'd ever made.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.880] And once again, it was the highest viewed part of that video.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.080] So it feels right to revisit the monster Samsung tablet since we don't get the chance
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.080] to do this every year and they do refresh it almost every year.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.600] Now back in 2020, the angle for what made this potential iPad killer was just this incredible
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.840] hardware, a massive OLED display in a razor-thin case in your hands.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.120] It barely feels real.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.120] It looks crazy.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.560] It looks like a movie prop.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560] It's awesome.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:08:03.760] So five years later, this is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and it's still pretty ridiculous.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.200] Now you might think that the iPad with all the improvements that it has made has eliminated
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.560] this ravioli because they've done like a lot of the things right that this used to do.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.640] It has that super super thin build now.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.400] It has Apple Silicon and it has iPad OS which has done a lot of cool things with software.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.240] But if you've been paying attention, the Samsung tablets have done a lot of that stuff
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.040] too and some new stuff.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.680] So it's keeping that ravioli alive.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:37.840] So the Tab S11 Ultra now has a ridiculous laptop size 14.6 inch 3K AMOLED display.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.320] That's still bigger and higher resolution than any iPad Pro with plenty of brightness and
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.600] pitch black blacks.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:51.000] It's also now even more thin than ever before at get this 5.1 millimeters.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.920] That's not just thinner than most tablets.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.960] That is thinner than the iPad Pro, thinner than the iPhone Air and just about anything
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.640] this big with a screen on it.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.280] And yet it still has a bigger battery and 11,600 milliamp hour battery.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.280] There's also still up to 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.840] There's still microSD card support for expandable storage but there's also still up to a
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.080] terabyte of built in storage.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.440] It also supports the new S Pen and it starts at 1200 bucks for the big one, which yes is
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.840] $100 less than the big iPad Pro.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.480] But maybe the most interesting is all the software features that Samsung added to this tablet
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.960] to keep it competing with iPad OS which just got that big makeover with iPad OS 26.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.160] So on the S11 Ultra you can have apps automatically load in windowed form every time.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.720] You can resize windows to whatever size and shape you want, like literally any size
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720] and any shape.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.960] The window management features are all super intuitive.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.900] You can throw a window over to the side of the screen, throw it up to the top to go full
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.900] screen.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.320] And then you can have multiple different desktops saved with these specific window layouts
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.600] to come back to.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.600] Easy.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.500] You can also link it to your phone so that you can make phone calls and send texts on your
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.500] tablet.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.600] Plus it's still crazy good at all that media stuff that's always been great at.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.560] It's still a wider aspect ratio than any iPad.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.360] The contrast ratio of AMOLED is still incredible.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.220] And another thing this isn't nanotexture by any means, but it does have pretty good
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.880] anti-reflective properties which make a difference to me in this light-filled studio.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.160] So this screen looks good all the time.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.680] So yes, the iPad has gotten better, but these Samsung tablets have definitely also gotten
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680] better.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680] Not a perfect.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.320] The Samsung quirks and this one also is not a Snapdragon chip, but still really good.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.280] And it's clear that they've positioned this right alongside the iPad as a viable alternative
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.200] and even a killer for some people.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200] Still dope tech.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.760] And I would also say, check out the video that I made on switching between iOS and Android
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.960] because there are a lot of things that these companies do to try to steal users from
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.280] each other and it's fascinating and it was worth an entire separate video.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.280] Now a quick word from today's sponsor.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.480] All right, thanks to Google and Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.200] So the holiday season is upon us and getting gifts for loved ones is always a tough dance
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200] to do.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.040] Like is this something actually want or is this a good price for this thing?
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.040] Where do I even start?
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.520] But the Google holiday 100 can help you make sure you're finding the best gifts because
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.080] they've taken all of the search and trends data from the past year and put it together
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.360] into a one-stop shop to find anything that anyone's interested in.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.880] And then alongside Google shopping, you also get a bunch of other tools to help you
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.320] sort through everything, probably the best of which being price insights, which literally
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.680] gives you the price trends of a thing you're going to get over time.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.080] So you can make sure it's really a sale when it says it's a holiday sale and all the products
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.200] are sorted into collections and categories.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.600] So you'll always have an easy jumping off point to find something you're interested in.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.880] And it's as easy as that.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.320] So which too is one of the biggest tech trends of 2025 and rightfully so got a bunch of
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.600] big upgrades from the last one, bigger screen, high refresh rate and of course the new Mario
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.760] card. So when you go to look for gifts this holiday season, check out the Google holiday
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.960] 100 at the link in the description.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.120] And thanks to Google shopping and Best Buy for helping me unwrap the holidays and be
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.320] a better gift giver.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.160] Alright, back to the video.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.760] So nine years ago, I did an 8K red camera on Dope Tech.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:24.920] And even longer ago, at CES 2016, I did the Nikon D500 in Dope Tech.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.240] And the reason I bring this up is in the meantime, you know, each company has released
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.760] several other cameras.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.040] But then something really interesting happened.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.240] Nikon bought red.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.600] Now, in the long, long history of people's favorite tech companies getting purchased, how
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.160] many of those are a story that ends with everyone being happy other than people getting
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160] paid.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.720] Not very many.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.560] But with this one, there was at least a chance.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.920] There was an opportunity for something really cool because Nikon had been toiling away
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.680] in maybe a distant third place to Canon and Sony for a while.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.480] And they've been looking for a way to just break into this mirrorless camera space.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.800] And red has been making incredible high quality cinema cameras and patting tons of technology
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.080] for a while, but never really coming down to an affordable price.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.000] So the question is, what are they going to do?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.360] Why did Nikon buy red?
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:26.680] Are they finally going to join forces and create something that can compete with Sony
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.160] and Canon in the mirrorless space?
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.840] Are they finally going to break out and make an affordable high quality camera that can
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.200] actually sell?
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.800] So we waited.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.120] And we waited.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.440] And this year, our patients was finally rewarded because they came out with this thing.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.400] This is the Nikon ZR.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.720] And this is a full frame mirrorless camera.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.080] A collaboration now that Nikon and Red are one with a 24 megapixel stack CMOS sensor,
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.560] Nikon Z mount, 6K 60 video, seven and a half stops of in-body image stabilization, 15 stops
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.720] of dynamic range.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:06.080] It shoots R3D and with this huge four-inch swiveling touchscreen on the back.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.080] This camera really comes out swinging.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.720] The spec sheet is awesome.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.440] And so it's less of like a Canon R5 competitor and more of like a FX3 competitor.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:22.040] FX3 is very popular, but that camera is $4,000 and this thing is about $2,200.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.360] So this thing immediately becomes very interesting, especially to me, so in who's been shooting
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.680] red for a while because it becomes right away the smallest red camera and becomes the red
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.640] camera probably with the best autofocus by a mile.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.280] And something I've talked about before is so many videos are actually shaped by the tools
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.480] in subtle ways, but if you make videos you kind of notice this stuff like MKBHD videos
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.080] for example, because I shoot them on mostly red cameras are all manual focus all the time
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.280] because they don't really have very good autofocus.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.840] But philosophically I feel like it should be the other way around.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.840] The tool should enable whatever creative thing you want to make.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.360] So as much as I love the quality of a red camera, I'm always interested in a more flexible
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:11.240] cameras, ones that I can go around and shoot in more flexible spaces and more scenarios,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.280] but the footage still looks really good.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.280] That's like the dream.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.840] So I obviously don't need this to be a picture taken camera by any means and it kind of
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840] isn't.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.200] I just need it to be able to travel more easily than this and shoot video that can match
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200] to it pretty well.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.040] And thankfully it does do that.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.160] It's not without its quirks.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.920] It also definitely has some little asterisks.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.240] So it's not exactly the same R3D, but it's R3D any, which is still compressed raw
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.680] and still pretty good, but a little bit different.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.280] But also as a video camera, the ergonomics are kind of weak.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.880] There is no EVF.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.360] There's no top handle.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.480] Even the side grip here is pretty small for a video focus camera.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.920] There's also a micro HDMI port instead of full size HDMI.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.160] There is a single CF express type B slot and then a micro SD card slot instead of another
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160] full size slot.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.400] I don't think I've ever seen that on a cinema camera.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.680] And at the end of the day is Z-mount, which means Nikon lens is fit natively, but the
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.960] Z-mount thankfully is very adaptable, so that isn't some horrible downside.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960] But yeah, that's about it.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.520] I really like this thing.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.120] It is an awesome camera with an awesome screen for an awesome price.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:23.120] But more amazingly, it is a result of two companies merging into one and the consumer
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.720] actually getting a win out of it.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.480] I feel like that never happens.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480] So I'm happy to see that.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.080] This obviously isn't a full review of this camera with a ton of sample footage, but I
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.600] will link some of my favorite reviews from other creators down below.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.880] So if you want to check that out, take it for me or take it from them.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.720] But yeah, another fun little random dope tech thing that's new versus what we've seen
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.720] in the past.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.120] And it's been a fun retro type of dope tech video.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120] Thanks for watching.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.440] Catch you guys the next one.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440] Peace.
