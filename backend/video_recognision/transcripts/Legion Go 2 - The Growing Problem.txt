[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240] Recently, I've been playing a lot of Marvel rivals on handhelds
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.800] because playing a casual shooter on a couch,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.120] along with these things is so much fun.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.640] Until I get on a losing streak
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.200] because at that point, I will plug up a mouse in keyboard
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.040] to one of these things to try to secure a W.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.040] I know, I'm pathetic, please don't judge me.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.360] But when this thing showed up,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.280] I was super excited to try because it's new hardware
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.920] and as we all know, new hardware makes you a better gamer.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.040] But this is the most powerful
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.760] and most complete gaming handheld package
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.840] on the market right now.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.640] This runs the new Z2 Extreme Chip from AMD.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400] It has a sweet new OLED panel,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.680] 120 Hertz variable refresh rate, 500 Nits, sports HDR,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.040] new speakers, new D-pad, new sticks, better ergonomics,
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.320] and the battery's 50% bigger this time around
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.720] than the previous generation.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.400] This is the most premium gaming handheld on the market.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.360] There's no question about it.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.520] However, in order to deliver this super premium experience,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.840] there are some trade-offs.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.280] The Legion Go 2 has gotten noticeably bigger.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.920] It's noticeably heavier.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.920] The fans are louder, presumably to handle the extra heat
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.600] and it's much more expensive.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.880] So bigger, thicker, heavier, louder, more expensive.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.200] These are all characteristics that are like the opposite
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280] of what we would want gaming handhelds to be, right?
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.800] We want these things to be thinner, lighter, quieter,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.440] cheaper if possible.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.760] Like we've had three years in a row now
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.680] where we've been going down this path of like more
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.520] and more and more.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.800] And I think this whole product genre
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.320] has this growing problem.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.680] And it stems from this thing right here, the Steam Deck.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800] So when this thing came out in 2022,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.040] this was, I think it was 400 bucks.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.640] And at the time, it's a decent performer.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.800] It was inexpensive.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.240] It was like an affordable product.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.840] And so for all the other companies
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.760] that made gaming handhelds,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.640] they realized that we cannot compete at $400 like Valve
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240] because Valve has a massive advantage.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.120] They own the Steam Store.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.680] So anytime they sell one of these things,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.640] it's just like a vessel.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.960] It's like a tool for them to just sell more games
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.640] and make money through game sales.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.840] But for everyone else, they can't do that.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600] So for all the other companies,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.680] they have to rely on performance.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.160] They have to rely on making a product
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.560] that is different from the Steam Deck
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560] that can do things that the Steam Deck can't do.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.400] Now on the Legion Go 2, it does a lot of cool stuff.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.360] It has different modes.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.400] You can set the device in for playing games
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.720] or watching stuff or even doing work if you want.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.400] And the new mouse mode is more comfortable
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.200] because the buttons and the controller shape
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.240] have been redesigned.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.360] And this FPS mode thing is legit.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.840] It's a very usable mouse when you need it.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.040] The new OLED screen is also awesome.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.240] 8.8 inches, great viewing angles,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.840] a good size for watching stuff.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.440] It is lower resolution than before.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.920] It's now 1200 P instead of 1600 P.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.160] But because it's an OLED,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.600] the visual experience on this is noticeably better
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.440] than what we saw on the previous generation.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.880] And also if you do drop down to a lower resolution,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.680] like 800 P, it doesn't have integer scaling,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.560] at least not clean integer scaling anymore,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.080] but it still looks really good on this panel.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.440] Battery life is definitely better than the first gen,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.320] but because it's a big OLED screen,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.720] it's still not a super long lasting device.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.760] When it comes to performance at the top end,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.760] select the highest wattage performance.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.080] It's like a 10, maybe 15% bump over the previous gen.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.600] It's not a massive game.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.840] The bigger gains come at lower wattages.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.960] So like that 10 to 15 watt range,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.800] the Z2 Xtreme really opens up
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.280] and we see like a 25 to 40%,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.880] but sometimes even like a 60% increase in performance
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.240] over the previous generation.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.520] The thing is though, this is a $1,500 device.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.960] I don't feel like most people are interested in this thing
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.240] to play like 2D and indie titles.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.640] They want something to play top end titles
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.560] and they're probably not going to be
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.280] wanting to be playing it at low wattages.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.600] Otherwise they would just get Steam decks
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.520] instead of Z2 Xtreme devices.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.440] And that's the problem with the entire industry right now.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.680] In 2025, we have an entire genre of products
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.800] that are just super expensive.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.880] These are gaming handhelds
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.960] that are bordering the price of like 16 inch gaming laptops.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.800] They're painfully expensive.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.840] They're also thicker, heavier, louder, bigger.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.840] But the price is the pain point.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.800] You see, the Legion Go 1 is now $700 at Best Buy.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600] It's not even like the cheapest you can get it out there,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.120] but this is a solid piece of hardware for that money.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.200] This thing, Legion Go 2 is almost $1,500.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.680] It's over double the price
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.960] for what I would say is like a mild improvement in performance.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.800] The hardware you get with it, fantastic.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.040] The screen, the controller, the new mouse,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.400] the new ergonomics, all great stuff.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.680] But $1,500 is so expensive.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.040] Like at this rate, Z3 Xtreme devices
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.400] are going to be like $2,000.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.840] It's just, it's wild.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.120] This is not what handhelds ever were built for.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.120] For this like crazy chase for price and performance.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.920] Like it's just, it's not what this product genre should be.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.080] What I would like to see is just pump the brakes
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.800] on chasing hardware and just focus on supporting
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.440] and optimizing the heck out of these existing chips
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.600] and just make them awesome
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.760] and make that experience cheaper thinner, lighter, better.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.480] But the Legion Go 2, if you can't afford it,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.960] this is arguably one of the best
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.840] Windows gaming handhelds on the market.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.840] It's awesome.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.320] It's just $1,500.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.520] Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video.
