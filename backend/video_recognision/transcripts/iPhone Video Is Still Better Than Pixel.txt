[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120] So I didn't think I was gonna make a review video on the pixels this year because I was super busy and also I booked a
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.120] Camping trip with my family just before this whole launch
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.240] But then I thought you won't make an even better camping trip for my family if I brought these phones along and made everybody wait for me while I did stuff
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.280] Every year at the end of the summer my wife and I try to bring her kids to some kind of camping or canoe trip
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.720] Somewhere in the Ontario parks. We load up the car and head up north
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.720] So on a side note my car is an electric vehicle. It's eight years old to this point. It's a 2017 model S
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.280] It holds like 80% of the charge at you to when it was new so at this point
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.920] I actually have to charge my car on the way up to campsites now battery degradation on EVs is very real
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.680] This year we went to a place called killbear provincial park and actually brought four phones with me
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.260] I got the pixel 10 pro XL last year's pixel 9 pro the iPhone 16 pro max as well as Samsung's S25 Ultra
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.040] Now my original plan was to shoot on all four of these but I recognized very quickly that my wife was gonna divorce me if I brought all four
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.180] So I only used two when we got to the campsite we pitched tents prep some wood and started a fire when I started shooting vids
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.420] The very first thing that jumped out to me was that the fires look way better on the iPhone 16 pro max compared to the pixel 10 pro XL
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.060] It's like the coloring the dynamic range on the flames
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.980] It's not an easy shot to capture because the flame is quite bright and it was getting darker
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.580] But the iPhone just did a better job at it another thing I noticed on the pixels that they still have this issue with movement
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.260] If you move the camera quickly you get this weird jarring like almost jutter to the video
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.020] It's something that's existed on a lot of the previous generation of pixel devices and it's still there
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.580] I'm surprised that year after year they still haven't been able to fix this and it's not as pronounced as it was on the pixel 9s
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.180] But it is still there now in terms of macro video
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.700] I found this crazy looking caterpillar crawling around on the cooler the iPhone macro mode capris is pretty well
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.140] It keeps a lot of it in focus, but the pixel 10 macro video captures this really well
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.500] It just looks cooler to me
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.580] It is a very narrow depth of fields of the focus a lot tighter and the shot just looks a lot more interesting to me
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.460] Low light videos were weirdly
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.500] Unimpressive on the pixel 10 pro XL like the iPhone 16 pro max looks so much better in the shot
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.940] It's kind of crazy. I always thought that pixels night sight was extra good and it works really well for photos
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.100] But when it comes to videos, it's actually quite poor now pixels can do something called video boost where it uploads video to the cloud for AI
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.460] Processing this helps with image quality a lot, but even with that new tensor g5 chip
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.660] This still isn't done on device. I'd the way it almost 20 hours for this video to be boosted
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.300] All right, so it's the next morning and I've run into a bit of a problem the one and only battery pack that I brought
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.820] Does not work. It's a big one, but it's older and the USB ports don't work the AC ports don't work
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.300] I do think that I could shoot all the video on these phones with just one charge. That's not an issue
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.260] It's just the edit. I have a laptop with one full battery charge. I don't know if I can do this all off of just one
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.100] Laptop battery. We'll see so in the afternoon
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.900] I took a short hike to the lighthouse here
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.060] It's very cool looking scenery on the shore of it the rocks have been eroded to these like very interesting looking slabs
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.780] Very nice view of the water some of the rocks here have this neon orange
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.900] Likin stuff growing on it when you take macro photos with the two cameras
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.380] You got the same kind of differences as the video
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.420] So the pixel has a very shallow depth of field and you just get more interesting looking shots with it
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.580] But you do need to be more careful with the focus. There's also a new camera coach feature on the new pixel phones
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.020] Where if you frame up a shot you can tap the camera coach button in the top corner and it'll think for a moment
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.500] Analyze your frame and then give you some suggestions for like some scenes and then also give you some guidance
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.220] It's how to shoot those scenes. It sounds neat and on paper
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.820] I feel like some people might think it might be useful
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.140] But here's my experience with it. I am a terrible photographer like just absolute dog water
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.220] But I didn't find useful. I felt like everything that it would suggest I either knew or just didn't want to bother doing
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.420] Like I would imagine that most people who actually care about their photos just already know most of the stuff
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.500] I just didn't find it useful also. I've noticed that the two front facing cameras because I'm shooting this so late
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.300] The pixel is so much worse at just this low light
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.420] Front facing video compared to the iPhone we also saw some deer kind of far away
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.260] I put this on 5x telephoto video for both devices the iPhone just did this better
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.820] I was trying to track the deer a little bit because I was so punched in and a small amount of hand movement at this
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.460] Kind of telephoto range would move the framing a lot
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.740] But the iPhone just handled that tracking better and the image on the iPhone just looked better
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.060] It was sharper and more clear now interestingly if you take photos or videos of
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.780] Text zoomed in the pixels are better at anything. It's just because of the AI processing
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.580] We saw a snake took a picture of it as Gemini what it was and I think it identified it correctly as non-venomous
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.740] But you never know with AI so we just stayed away from it
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.140] The photo capabilities on the pixel 10 are quite good as you'd expect pixels never disappoint when it comes to stills
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.540] The newest feature for the pixel 10 XL is the 100x pro resume. It's a huge AI model
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.420] It's over a gig this works surprisingly well in a handful of shots out here
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.820] But it didn't look great for most attempts. It's quite grainy and because I'm out camping
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.020] I'm gonna keep this video super short
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.740] I spent all of my time with this phone focused on the video capabilities and I will say if it just look at video
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.900] It's not particularly impressive this year. I was hoping they're almost expecting it to be really good with camera capabilities
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.660] This year just based off of their presentation and their kind of press release
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.580] But it's very pixel-like and not all that different from the previous generation
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.940] But we will explore this phone with its full capabilities
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.900] Down the line. All right. Hope you guys enjoyed this video
