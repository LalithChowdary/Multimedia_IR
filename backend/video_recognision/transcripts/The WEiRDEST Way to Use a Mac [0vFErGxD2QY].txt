[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600] I was on a video call with one of my friends.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300] When he started screen sharing on his Mac
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.680] and when it popped up, it looked something like this.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.720] And I was like, what the hell is this?
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.000] Like, what am I even looking at?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.760] And he goes, this is my workspace that I built for myself.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.960] I'm like, what?
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.800] There's no way.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.960] This is a regular Mac.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960] You actually use it like this.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.800] And he's like, yeah, it's just a Mac terminal.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.160] So on this panel, I can keep track of stocks
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.480] and currencies in real time.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.760] And I also have a weather widget, a calendar.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.960] I have my news and RSS feed here.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.720] I have a Spotify player for music
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.120] and then I have a system monitor,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.520] like a pretty extensive one.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.000] And also the file manager thing.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600] And all of this, because it's a terminal app,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.840] was only being made with text characters.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.040] Even a YouTube video that was being streamed in
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.160] was being made with exclusively text characters.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.840] So at this point, when I had just been shown this,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.040] the first thought I had was like, this is crazy.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.520] I didn't even know that Macs could even be run like this,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.320] or at least have the degree of functionality
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.240] that this had in terminal.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.800] But the second thing that came to my mind was like,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.400] why would anybody do this?
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.320] Like why would you ever run your computer
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.560] in a terminal like this,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.680] when there's like a really nice gooey
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.160] that's built into Mac OS?
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.440] But my friends, since he uses it,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.160] because he wanted to build a customized workspace
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.840] that was extremely minimal
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.120] and has everything he needed in one space.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.200] So this is how he does it.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.360] And if you want to try it out for yourself,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.920] there'll be details in the description.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.360] But it turns out every modern Mac can do this
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.200] out of the box.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.680] This isn't some crazy Linux install.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.960] This is just Mac terminal program
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.200] that gives you command line control of your system.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.040] But my friend doesn't use the default terminal program
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.080] that comes with Mac OS.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.560] He uses one called Ghosty.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.760] And because he's a developer,
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.520] he spends a lot of his time looking at code
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.080] in an app called Helix.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.600] And he's tweaked his workspace
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.240] to have very particular colors.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.800] Like he's built this color palette
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.320] of low contrast pastel colors
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.240] that also match the like six colors
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.520] on the Apple logo or the old Apple logo.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.120] But he wanted very specific colors
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.480] to indicate certain elements in his code.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.440] He also showed me this crazy way
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.800] to stream YouTube videos in here.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.920] So if you remember,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.680] terminal apps only support text characters.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.840] But if you decrease the font size of that text enough,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.560] you can get it to a high enough resolution
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.400] so you can actually make sense of what is that you're watching.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.800] There's also a browser that he'll occasionally use
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.160] that also does something similar.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.200] It's called Browse.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520] And it renders any kind of like graphics-based HTML
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.360] as colored text characters.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.880] Again, it's not individual pixels.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.600] It's just colored text blocks that are simulating pixels.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.280] But keep in mind that if my friend actually
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.120] wanted to watch a video or do something
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.320] that had any kind of graphics on it
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.480] and he wants to do it properly,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.520] he would just all tab into the regular Mac OS
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.960] and just do whatever he wanted to do in like Safari
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.120] or a regular browser.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.280] But the fact that it's able to be done at all
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.360] in a text-based space is crazy.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.400] Also, I saw an Nintendo emulator
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.680] that was running in the Mac terminal.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.160] It's like playing Nintendo games in a text-based terminal.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920] Now ultimately, the reason why my friend
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.080] even uses this whole text-based environment
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.960] is for productivity.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.800] He wants to be focused in his work
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.400] and like this is his way of dealing with distractions.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.240] Because if you don't have access to really nice browsers
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.920] and like really functional graphics,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.760] you tend to just do your work,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.960] at least in his mind, that's why he does it.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.400] Now I can absolutely see this being useful
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.600] for certain types of workflows
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.480] and people just want like a very minimal workspace.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.280] So the reality is that when I first saw this,
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.360] when he first showed this to me,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.440] my first reaction after just like laughing at it
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.080] is that this is way too hardcore for myself to use.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.120] Like this is not the type of workflow that I want.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.720] However, after I set it up,
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.760] because I had to set it up to just kind of experience
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.040] and recreate it so I can show this stuff to you,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.880] there's something really charming about this environment.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.360] It's hard to describe in words,
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.720] but it feels so analog and so old school.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.800] And the fact that you're doing it on Apple hardware,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800] like this isn't like a typical Linux system, right?
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.480] This is a regular MacBook.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.680] And if you ever want to leave that environment,
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.480] just go into Mac OS, it's literally an all tab away.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.960] So I don't think this is for everyone,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.800] like certainly not.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.440] This is definitely not like an everyday daily driver
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.880] for the vast majority of people,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.480] but I think if you've ever been interested in this stuff,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.520] the fact that Apple can do this out of the box,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.240] like without any kind of crazy installs
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.640] is like a 15 minute setup.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.680] It's pretty cool.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.920] So I'm putting it out there.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.640] It is a very weird way to use your Mac,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.880] but if you're interested, now you know about it.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.040] All right, hope you guys enjoyed this video.
