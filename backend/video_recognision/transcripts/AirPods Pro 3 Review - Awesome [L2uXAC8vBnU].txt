[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020] All right, the AirPods Pro 3.
[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.680] So Apple hyped these so hard at their launch event
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.700] and for good reason,
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.960] because these are legitimately awesome.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.280] So I got these in right after the event,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.280] popped them in, awesome ANC, awesome mics,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.880] really cool new tips that are much more comfortable,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.880] great battery life.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.320] There's so much stuff that's happening here
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.120] that is just truly best in class,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.240] or best in the market.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.600] However, there's one thing that bugs me the moment
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.640] I put these in and start testing them.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.400] It's that whenever I would listen to music
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.640] and then pop in the old APP2's, AirPods Pro 2's,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.120] I preferred the sound from AirPods Pro 2.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.960] So when I got home, I started doing some blind listening tests.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.640] I set them up in my bedroom, I was listening with my wife
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960] and we both consistently preferred the sound from APP2.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.680] And it was not every single track,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.720] but the vast majority of them.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.520] It was strange and we've tried to trick each other.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.400] We would like try to pretend to switch buzz
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.800] and like it was proper AB testing.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.080] Now if I had to describe why,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.240] it's that the sound of APP2 just sounded more natural.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.720] Like this sounded, maybe I'm just used to it,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.080] but it just sounded the way it should.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.040] But on APP3, it sounded like,
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.960] I'm using words that describe audio here,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.280] but it sounded like the tracks were stretched artificially
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.560] to just give them like an artificial sense of like extra detail.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.320] And it just didn't sound the way that I felt like the music should.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.000] Now I took these devices and measured them
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.560] with this Eard tube apparatus.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.040] It's a very simple ear canal and ear drum simulator.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.360] And these are the measurements.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.080] So this is for AirPods Pro 2
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.520] and then this is for AirPods Pro 3.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.840] So a few things caught my eye on these plots.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.960] The APP3s, the new ones have more sub bass.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.360] There's not a lot of music that actually goes down
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.600] to those frequencies, but if you listen to stuff
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.160] that has really, really deep and low bass,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160] the new APP3s do a better job at presenting that sound.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.280] But secondly, if you look at the bass on the APP3s,
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.200] there's a dip there.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.960] And I've seen some earbuds do this
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.120] to emphasize the sub bass more.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.240] Like when you carve out a little bit of that bass
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.560] and remove it, that sub bass just pops out a little bit more.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.760] There's just more contrast
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.240] because of that missing kind of middle area in that bass.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.240] And I'm not sure if that's why Apple did it,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.800] but I've definitely seen other brands do it
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.200] to make the lower frequencies pop.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.680] And some people like that.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.120] There's also a blip or like a peak at 2.5 kHz
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.760] that exists on APP3, that did not exist on APP2.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.160] And these were a little bit weird to me.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.080] I measured this multiple times and they're there
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.680] on both the left and right buds.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.640] I'm not sure why.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.200] Now these characteristics that I'm drawing your attention to,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.160] these are like the main things that stood out to me.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.480] But it's not that I'm seeing this plot is bad
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.080] or that APP3 is worse than APP2.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.920] It's not, it's just that it's not obviously better.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.400] Now for me, APP2 had amazing sound.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.840] And I would put them at like a nine out of 10.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.800] APP3, I put them at like 8.8.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.600] Just slightly worse based on my personal preferences
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.800] in sound.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.680] Now the rest of the product is so much better.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.720] Like literally every other characteristic
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.760] and every the feature of APP3 is amazing.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.200] So the first is the fit.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.080] These sit and fit differently in your ear
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.680] than the previous generation.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.960] There's a protrusion that comes out a little bit
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.840] from the earbud before it goes into your ear canal.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.920] So this sticks out just a couple of millimeters,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.600] but it makes the whole product stick away.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.280] Like when this thing rests in your ear,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.120] it actually rests a little bit further away from your ear
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.960] than the previous APP2.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960] So this is the old one.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.080] And when you take off your tip,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.440] like that little protrusion isn't there.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.600] So this just sits more flush to your head
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.160] or to your ear actually.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.600] And this wasn't as comfortable.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.160] I much prefer the fit and feel of the new one.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.920] The new ones are fractionally heavier than the APP2,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.240] but the extra weight is completely imperceptible
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.680] when you're wearing them.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.680] The tips, so these have that new foam infused silicone tips.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.520] They come with five tip sizes now.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.960] There's now an extra, extra small at the smallest end,
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.720] which actually fits the ear canal of my six year old.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.440] Not that I'll ever get a pair of $250 ear buds
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.240] for my six year old, but I feel like that's what
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.040] they're aiming at for, like the younger audience
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.960] for these things to fit for them.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.440] I don't find AirPods Pro to be uncomfortable.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.800] I just find APP3 to be a little bit better
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.480] for long-term wear, but they didn't stay in my ear
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.120] all that well when playing sports.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.800] I'd still want the hooks from Power Beats 2 for that.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.640] Now in terms of active noise cancellation,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.760] these are crazy powerful.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.520] Like APP2 was already amazing with ANC.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.440] These just take it to another level.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.280] They're awesome.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.720] So we can use the little ear tube
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.280] to simulate what it sounds like fairly accurately.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440] I don't know if it's double the ANC like they claim,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.680] but this has very effective active noise cancellation.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.400] And it's three things that are contributing to this.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.760] First are the foam infused seals.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.480] These do a better job than before.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.040] Secondly, it's the computation around that ANC,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.840] but third is the microphones.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.360] The mics on AirPods Pro 3 are excellent.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.720] I'm using them right now to record this
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.440] so you're going to get a sense of what they sound like.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.720] They're obviously great for taking a collar, whatever,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.960] but if you had to use some kind of microphone
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.720] in a pinch for recording yourself
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.920] or some kind of content creation,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.800] they're totally usable if you have nothing else.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.760] Now in terms of noise cancellation of background sounds,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.600] they're not great.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.960] This is a hair dryer here.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.560] You can still hear a lot of that hair dryer over this.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.040] So it's not great for killing the environmental sound,
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.080] but when you compare to the mics on AirPods Pro 2,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.960] these sound noticeably worse.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.280] Now with these excellent mics,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.840] you also get a top tier transparency mode.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.280] This sounds so natural on APP3.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.440] It almost sounds like you don't even have ear buds
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.280] in your ear.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.000] The voices that come through,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.760] they just sound remarkably similar to just an actual voice.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.200] The listening mode is off right now,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.920] but when you play this transparency mode,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.280] it opens up and my voice does come through
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.960] in a pretty natural tone.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.160] There's also the new live translation function.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.680] It's currently in beta, but this works on device.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.200] It doesn't send anything to the cloud.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.080] You do need to download the language pack
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.760] that you want to translate in advance.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.760] Once you do, it seems to work really well
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.800] with those one-on-one conversations.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.080] For something really very cheap.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.840] It's going to be a bit of a challenge,
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.040] especially for my $3,
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.120] but I can try to find a really economical option.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.760] There is a little bit of a delay in that translation,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.520] because it's waiting for the speaker to finish its sentence
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.400] to capture the proper context,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.200] but I found it plenty fast enough.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.800] And just the conversation flow wasn't broken
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.000] because of that delay.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.640] I found it very useful.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.720] It is, though, coming to other devices.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.760] So APP2 and AirPods 4 are getting it down the line,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.520] but I do wonder how much the mic quality
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.400] will have an effect on how good
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.360] that live translation experience will be,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.480] because these have really good mics.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.880] There's a heart rate sensor now on AirPods Pro 3,
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.080] that work in a very similar fashion to what we saw
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.000] on the Powerbeats Pro 2, a little while back.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.280] And these are very accurate.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.520] From all the testing I've done,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.000] it's surprising that something that's situated
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.360] in your ear canal can just capture a good heart rate,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.960] but it works.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.400] You do need to have this near your phone
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.320] and or watch to about to capture it.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.720] You can't just do a workout or run on these
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.720] without your watch or phone nearby,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.680] and hope that it transfers over later.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.360] You have to have your phone or your watch nearby,
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.200] and it'll work.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.880] It does feel a little redundant,
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.320] but if you can't or don't want to wear a watch,
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.520] this'll do it, but it only works with certain workouts
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.840] in the fitness app right now.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.960] Now in terms of battery life,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.960] the APP3 claimed eight hours with ANSI on,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.200] which is up from the six hours of APP2
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.840] from a few years back.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.560] From my testing, I only did one rundown.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.080] I got almost nine hours of battery life with APP3.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.840] This is with volume at like 40, 50%.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.840] So I didn't crank it, but it's a very long lasting device.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.360] Now the case doesn't hold as much.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.560] This is a 24 hour total battery,
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.440] with like the recharge from the case.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.280] This was 30.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.680] Now just anecdotally,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.080] this is now a three year old product for me.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.840] I got this very close to when it launched.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.960] This barely gets four hours of battery at this point.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.600] It originally was six hours.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.040] I did the testing years ago,
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.240] but it's now just over four hours.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.040] So degradation is very real on these things.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.240] The batteries are tiny,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.160] so I wouldn't be surprised if they just degrade aggressively.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.960] Now price wise,
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.720] these are relatively expensive
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.280] on the wireless earbud market.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.200] These cost $250.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.520] The thing is you can get pretty good sounding ones
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.840] for like 150 bucks.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.120] Like the nothing ears are significantly cheaper than these.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.080] You got a ton of really impressive features with APP3,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.080] but it comes at a price.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.200] Now, here's my take on this.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.200] I think a lot of people buy Apple's AirPods Pros exclusively
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.240] for just the audio experience.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.240] And the question I think a lot of people have,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.080] if they already own an APP2,
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.320] should they get the APP3?
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.880] And my take on it is this.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.000] If what you use it for is just listening to music
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.320] and you already are completely satisfied
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.320] with the very powerful ANC of APP2,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.160] I don't see why it would be worth getting these.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.640] If that's what you're using for, just listening to music.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.760] But if you like all the crazy features that APP3 has,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.000] particularly if it involves the microphone,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.720] because it's just got a kick ass microphone system,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.400] then yeah, there's literally nothing else in the market
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.280] that does it as good as this product.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.400] It's really good.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.360] It's just that in terms of the audio,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.640] I thought APP2 was actually a little bit better.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.040] Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.080] Hope I saved the few people $250.
