[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500] I like thin and light tech a lot.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.860] The laptops that I choose, the desk tops that I build,
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.100] I will purposely choose devices that have worse performance
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.260] or louder fans and sometimes just higher price tags
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.140] just because I value the small form factor so much.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.700] So when the new iPhones came out a couple of weeks ago,
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.620] that very obvious choice for me,
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.100] I wanted the iPhone Air to be my device for this year.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.800] Like it's designed so well.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.700] If you haven't seen Zach Ben this thing,
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.620] go watch this video, it is wild.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.500] How much force this phone needs to break.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.460] But the iPhone Air looks really cool.
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.500] It feels nice in hand.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.460] It is arguably Apple's most interesting phone
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.700] they've made in years.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700] But I wanna address four pain points
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.620] that definitely exists on this phone.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.740] Three of them, I don't think are as bad
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.780] as they're being made out to be.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.460] But the last one is something that I think
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.380] is a bigger issue for a lot of people
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.180] and potentially a deal breaker.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.220] So I thought right when they announced this thing
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.820] that the battery life would hold it back
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.220] because in 2025 consumers have access
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.940] to so many incredible phones with crazy long battery life.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.700] And in comparison, if you compare the iPhone Air
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.140] to one of those high-end flagships with big batteries,
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.300] this has a very short battery life.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.620] But the other way to look at it
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.580] is if you compare this iPhone Air
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.340] to a normal phone that people would be upgrading from.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.300] So like a three or four year old phone,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.260] this actually has very good battery life.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.100] It's not great, but it's a legit full day battery
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.420] because Apple's put a lot of work
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.180] into the efficiency of this phone.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.380] So if you're using for regular stuff,
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.500] I think it's a comfortable full day.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.580] If you play games, you're gonna have to charge
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.540] the same halfway through the day.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.260] It's just, it's built for a very light
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.860] to moderate load for a full day.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.740] Now there is the battery pack that you can get from Apple.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.860] It's a same size pack inside the MagSafe pack
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500] as the one that's inside the phone itself.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.660] A full MagSafe pack gives about 65% charge to the phone
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.420] because wireless charging is inefficient
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060] and you lose some of it to heat.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.980] But even though it does fit nicely,
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.180] it is unfortunate that you have this thin phone
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.100] that becomes like a normal sized thick phone
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.500] with the pack on.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.780] Okay, the second thing I wanna talk about is the camera.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.420] So it's a single camera system on the air
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.540] and I'm happy with it.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.620] It's a good shooter, it's great when low light.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.260] It's really good in videos because it's iPhone.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.780] I found that in the past two weeks,
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.860] I just didn't miss the telephoto
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.900] or the ultra-wide all that much in my day to day.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.860] I do think that if I was traveling frequently
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.900] or going to events like concerts and stuff,
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.060] I would miss it a lot more.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.220] Like I go through my camera roll
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.700] and all my photos are just like the regular lens typically
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.580] unless I go to places or I'm traveling,
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.420] then I'll use the extra focal length.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.300] So I think if you're on the fence about this,
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.260] looking you're a camera roll,
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.620] just go through and be like,
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.740] what percentage of my photos were shot on lenses
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.860] other than the main?
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.660] And I think that'll just make it easier to decide
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.660] whether or not this is a good fit for you.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.060] The front facing camera is much improved this year.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.740] It has been detailed in my Pro video,
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.460] but yeah, it's a way better front facing camera.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.500] And it's the same camera across all of the iPhones this year.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.620] The third issue I wanna address is performance.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.620] So the iPhone Air definitely gets hotter than I expected.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.340] They've stacked this with 12 gigs of RAM
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.620] and it's got the Pro chip,
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.300] but when you look at the thermals of these devices,
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.620] the Pro with its vapor chamber and aluminum chassis
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.340] just handles heat much better than the Air
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.940] with its glass back and titanium frame.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.380] And when you look at sustained performance
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.020] between an Air and a Pro,
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.500] it is obvious that the Pro just builds to be pushed
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.580] for a long time with performance in mind.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.420] The Air is not.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.460] So if you crank the iPhone Air,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.780] you will have the deal with heat and performance throttling.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.780] It's not gonna affect the normal user,
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.060] but if you want to play a lot of 3D games
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.700] or you edit videos and cap cut on your phone,
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.060] I'd go for a different device.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.780] All right, the fourth issue I wanna talk about is the speaker.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.260] This has a single speaker and it's been eight years
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.820] since I reviewed a phone with a single speaker.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.820] Single meaning like mono speaker.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.500] There's no stereo sound.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.700] So even the S25 Edge, which is also a very thin phone,
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.580] this device had two speakers with the single speaker
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.420] on the iPhone Air.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.820] You get mono sound that comes at the top in portrait mode,
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.060] but then in landscape mode,
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.860] you get mono sound that comes out on one side alone.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.220] And it's a very thin and flat driver,
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.660] so you don't get a lot of bass,
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.940] but every time I watch a show or play a game
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.820] and just use these speakers,
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.500] I'd be like, these are actually suck.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.660] But then the real problem, volume.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.220] I measured these speakers with a calibrated U-Mike
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.220] and there's about a 10 decibel difference
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.900] between the iPhone Air and the iPhone 17.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.260] 10 decibels, that's a perceived difference
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.980] of almost double the volume for the iPhone 17.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.340] It is very significant.
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.460] Now we need to be clear,
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.660] it's not like you can't hear anything on the iPhone Air.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.900] You can hear it, it's just a lot quieter
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.140] than a typical modern day smartphone.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.780] Now I first noticed it when I got a FaceTime call,
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.380] I was out in the backyard with my kids.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.900] We often take a call from my mom
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.100] and we just do it as a thing.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.620] None of us could hear it properly.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.540] We all had to go into the house and take the call there
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.900] and it didn't clue in then.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.500] I was just like, oh, maybe it was just like a noise
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.340] your evening.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.460] But then I think it was like two or three days after.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.140] I was cooking and this is something I do very often.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.700] I have like the air sucking thing going on in my kitchen.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.540] I'm cooking stuff.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.060] I was just like chopping some stuff up
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.980] and I got a call and I'm going to speak her phone.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.220] I had to turn off the fan and turn off the gas stove
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.540] just so I could hear the conversation.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.700] That's when I clicked and I was like,
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.780] this, I think this is a real issue.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.180] Now it's not gonna affect everybody.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.620] Obviously most people don't even use this stuff.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.660] I do think that if you FaceTime regularly
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.060] in an environment where if you have like kids
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.100] and family and you take FaceTime calls with multiple people
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.180] and they're just like ambient noise in the environment,
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.860] you will absolutely notice the difference
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.420] between the iPhone Air and basically every other phone
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.860] that's available on the market with two speakers.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.660] Hey, this is just a voice from the speaker here.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.940] The difference between calling between two different phones.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.500] Hey, this is just a voice from the speaker
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.700] and the difference in calling between the two different phones.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.900] It is not loud enough in noisy environments.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.900] So if you are someone who uses FaceTime
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.500] or the speaker phone very often with a lot of ambient noise,
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.940] you should take that in consideration.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.820] Now, when you look at the four individual issues
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.340] that I've talked about, so the battery, the camera,
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.020] the performance, the speakers, I don't think any one of them
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.780] is like an immediate deal breaker universally, right?
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.460] It, I think though that most people will be affected
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.420] by at least one or more of the four.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.420] And the thing is the novelty of the thinness of this phone
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.500] wears off pretty quickly.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.420] I'm on, I'm wrapping up week two.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.860] And it's still like every time I pick it up,
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.260] like this is super thin, this is awesome.
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.140] But I'm like, I don't feel like my life has changed
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.300] all that much going from like a very thin phone
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.340] to an extremely thin phone.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.740] It is neat to pull out of your pocket
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.940] and like when my kids handle, they're like,
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.220] wow, this is super thin.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.460] But the novelty is definitely worn off.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.700] And the thing I'm trying to convey is that
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.740] the novelty of it, like you don't want
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.060] several months from now or like year from now,
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.580] when you're still using this phone to be like,
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.620] man, I've run into all these little obstacles
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.020] and I keep having to avoid them and dodge them
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.380] and kind of adjust how I use my phone
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.980] because I went for thinness.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.020] Like I did this to myself, damn it.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.420] I kind of regret getting the super thin phone.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.540] That is the mistake that I think we all are trying to avoid.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.220] And I would say that for most people,
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.580] if you look at that list of problems,
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.260] and one of them kind of, it bothers you
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.500] a little bit right now.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.460] I would skip it and go for a different phone.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.500] But if you look at the list, you're like,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.620] yeah, man, I'm good with that.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.620] None of that affects me.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.900] I can charge it from regularly.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.900] I charge it at work all the time.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.220] I don't really use my camera.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.500] I don't really use FaceTime and loud environments.
