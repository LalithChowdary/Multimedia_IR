[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800] So the iPhone lineup got a massive overhaul this year.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.840] We're seeing big jumps in performance,
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.360] in battery life, in camera capabilities.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.080] This is a very stacked year for Apple's iPhones.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.120] So these are the review units I got in as 17,
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.120] an air and both pros.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.640] This year, the pros of boxes that showcase
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.200] the backs of the devices.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.680] And because it's a full metal unibody back,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.520] the boxes are printed with this shiny metallic ink.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.160] And inside, because there are mostly
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.920] E-SIM devices around the world,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.920] there's no more SIM tool.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.200] You just get the charging cable,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.560] as well as a single piece of paper that says
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.800] that you no longer need SIM tools.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.280] Welcome to the world of E-SIMs, even up here in Canada.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.160] Okay, so these are the four devices that have
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.640] the regular iPhone 17 is pretty much the same aesthetic
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.480] as last year.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.960] It's probably the sleeper phone from Apple's lineup this year.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.440] This is a very awesome device.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.440] It just doesn't look all that special.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160] The iPhone Air is super thin.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.320] This will get its own video in the near future
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.160] because this deserves entire different kind of conversation.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.800] But the Pro devices are a very different
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.600] and unexpected shape this year.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240] These, right when I first saw them,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.080] I was like, these are so big and bulbous.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080] And a week later, I still think they're large,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.560] but they've definitely grown on me.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.680] These do not look or feel anything
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.400] like previous generations of iPhones.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.360] The biggest shift is just that unibody design.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.360] This bottom panel here is now rounded
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.200] and because it's just one piece of metal
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.880] that is the entire chassis,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.160] it just sits in your hand very differently.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.960] The orange color is super orange.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.800] When I saw this at the event,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.080] I was like, this is way too loud.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.320] Getting it in studio, it's even louder.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.480] The blue has grown on me.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.040] This is like, yeah, this is a really nice blue.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.280] It just looks better with the nice studio lighting
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.280] than it did at the event.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.160] All of the iPhone 17 devices have ceramic shield two
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.000] on the front glass.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.680] This is less reflective and more scratch resistant
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680] than last year's glass.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.400] But if you want to fully protect your phone,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.240] you still need a case and screen protector.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.080] This is the new ghost case from Debrand,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.640] but they have a new one this year called TANK
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.520] with customizable buttons.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520] So both the displays, the iPhone 17 finally gets
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.720] the 120Hz promotion panel.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.880] I'd love to believe that Apple did this in response
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.000] to us tech nerds begging for it,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.520] but I don't think that's the case.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.800] I think Apple was just like, ah,
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.960] it's finally the right time.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.840] We're done milking our customers
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840] with their 60Hz panels.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.920] The other displays are also very nice.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.560] These are all finally like 120Hz promotion OLED.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.520] They've basically caught up to the rest of the Android world.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.560] It's a very exciting time for iPhone users
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.640] because we finally have good screens
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.720] across the entire lineup.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.920] They also get brighter at the top in this year.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.680] It can go to 3000 nits at the top outdoors.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.920] And it's a lot brighter in terms of numbers
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.360] than the 2000 of the previous generation,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.440] but keep in mind that even though these are a thousand more
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.320] nits than the previous generation at the top
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.520] and how we perceive light is logarithmic.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.840] So it's not as big of a jump as you might think.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.480] Now in terms of battery life, these two devices,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.720] the Pro and the Pro Max
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.320] have very impressive battery life,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.000] but it does drink quite fast in heavy games.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.680] If you don't slam the GPU though,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.480] I think that Pro Max is a two day battery for many people.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.000] And if you're someone that takes advantage
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.520] of the optimized battery charging,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.320] like the thing that caps it up to 80%
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.280] to preserve the kind of longevity of your battery life,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.480] because this is so big,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.920] it's still going to be like a day and a half battery
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.840] at an 80% charge.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.400] Charging is faster on some of the iPhone 17s.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.480] They can hit 40-bar charging if the battery's depleted enough
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.880] and it'll sustain it for a little bit of time,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.000] but then it'll drop down quite quickly.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.240] The pack on the iPhone Air,
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.160] like the battery here is way better performing
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.280] than I thought it would be,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.400] just because it's how thin it is.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.680] It's actually quite impressive.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.160] The only thing that buzz me out is that the pack is just,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.040] it's so unique to this thing.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.040] Like nothing else can hold this pack properly.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.840] Even the big iPhone 17 Pro Max,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.160] I demoed this at the event,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.320] but like I thought maybe at home
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.080] I can just finagle it enough to get it to fit, it doesn't.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.400] It's just, it's so frustrating.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.080] It'll charge because like the coils are somewhat aligned,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.400] but for proper like magnet to magnet contact,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.720] it only works on the iPhone Air.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.040] So unfortunate.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.400] Okay, performance, every year we get a new chip
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.040] and it's faster like you'd expect.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.800] Last year was an unusually large jump in performance
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.680] for both CPU and GPU.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.960] This year is actually an even larger step up in performance.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.200] The A19 Pro chips are very powerful.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.960] Now I'm sure the chip and the architecture
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.240] and all the engineering around it is fantastic,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.240] but I think a big part of why they're performing so well
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.880] is because of that new vapor chamber.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.240] So they showed the thing at the event.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.400] It seems like a very interesting piece of technology.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.760] We actually got the demo at Apple.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.280] We got to like hold in and put them in hot water
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.600] just to see how they work.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.560] The thing that, okay, just to be clear
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.720] what a vapor chamber even does, it's really simple.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.760] It just takes heat and then spreads it out evenly
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.040] across the surface very quickly.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.560] Now on these phones, they're just doing it to pull off heat
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.960] from the chips and all that super hot dense area
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.640] and pull it away onto the outer aluminum shell
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.760] or the bodies to radiate heat.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.840] There's no vent, there's no like active air flow here.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.760] It's just passive dissipation of heat,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.120] but because that vapor chamber is so effective,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.680] it allows Apple to crank these devices a little bit harder
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.240] knowing that they can dump off that heat
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.800] a little bit more effectively.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.080] And these pro phones are able to sustain
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.400] a high level of performance for a surprisingly long time.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.480] And I also think that if they took that vapor chamber
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.280] just stuck it into this chassis,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.720] like the existing iPhone 16 Pro chassis,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.920] it wouldn't be nearly as effective,
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.840] like the glass and titanium isn't nearly as thermally
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.520] conductive and that vapor chamber
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.640] would've been wasted in this device.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.680] Now you get 12 gigs of RAM on the Pro models,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.080] same with the iPhone Air.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.960] The regular iPhone 17 just gets eight gigs of RAM.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.040] It's not immediately clear as to what that extra RAM
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.880] is really for.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.960] If you think about last year,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.560] Apple was selling these devices,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.960] their flagship devices with just eight gigs of RAM
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.960] and they were telling the whole,
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.920] these devices are future forward.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.600] It's gonna be Apple intelligence ready
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.840] and all that stuff.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.720] Maybe they ran into some kind of like technical obstacle
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.960] where they realized the only way to deliver the things
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.640] that they promised they would deliver last year
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.520] is just like stock these things with 12 gigs of RAM.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.600] Who knows?
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.040] But I do think it's gonna be something that's forward looking.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.240] It may be revealed at WWDC
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.680] as to why that extra RAM is necessary or beneficial.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.640] A couple of things that do come to mind though,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.920] I do think that right now when you use Apple intelligence
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.520] and you're trying to use the on device language models,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.560] there's a little bit of a delay.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.160] Like I think there's some swapping of memory
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.360] like as it's loading the model in and out of memory.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.000] I do think that if you have more RAM,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.160] you can keep the model in memory just ready to go
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.400] at all times so that's series a little bit more responsive.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.360] Maybe I don't think it's camera related though
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.320] because the air even with that single camera
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.800] still gets 12 gigs.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.880] Okay, speaking of cameras, on the pro models,
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.200] we have a camera system where all three cameras
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.080] are finally running 48 megapixel sensors.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.800] This is something I think a lot of the camera enthusiasts
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.600] were hoping would eventually happen.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.960] The biggest change comes for that telephoto
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.680] with its 4x optical zoom,
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.560] which is technically a step down from the 5x
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.080] that we saw on last year's device.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.320] But the sensor is way bigger this year,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.400] which allows Apple to do that cropped sensor thing
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.560] that they like to do,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.960] which technically gives them an optical like 8x zoom.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.800] So now on the pro iPhones, you get a camera system
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.640] with high resolution and more importantly,
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.200] large sensors to go with it.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.960] And you just get way better image quality
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.400] when you combine the two like that.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.360] The 4x optical is sharper than last year's 5x.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.840] And then when you do use that 8x crop in,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.120] you lose some of that sharpness
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.120] because you're using a smaller portion of that sensor,
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.640] but it still looks good.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.680] I think this is the most complete camera package
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.560] that Apple's ever put on any of the phones
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.160] where all of the lenses just feel sharp and very usable.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.200] The main camera and the ultra wide deliver
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.000] really good pictures,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.360] but even on the iPhone 17 Pro Max,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.800] I still think pixel and Samsung flagships
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.560] delivers something a little better in the stills department,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.760] especially in low light conditions.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.880] Now for video, iPhones are typically better in this space.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.760] It's definitely better than the Pixel's video output.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.160] I do think that Samsung's S25 Ultra
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.480] like their flagship can be quite competitive.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.360] The Samsung handles colors a little bit better,
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.480] but iPhone handles imperfect lighting
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.840] a little bit more reliably.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.560] If you're interested in 4K, 120 frames per second video,
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.880] the pro models can do it.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.960] The iPhone Air cannot do it,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.200] despite having the same kind of chip.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.920] Well, it's got a bend down GPU,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.160] so it's got one Coral S,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.400] but this cannot do that high frame rate video,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.560] or like that super high frame rate video that these two can.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.520] The front facing camera is also so much better.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.880] The old one was a 12 megapixel sensor.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.640] The new one's 18 megapixels,
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.520] and it's a much larger sensor.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.760] You can do landscape selfies
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.480] without actually rotating the device.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.800] And everything about this new front facing camera is better.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.960] The weight handles color, the weight handles lighting,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.720] it's just an awesome improvement.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.440] And this is on all of the new iPhone 17 devices,
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.920] including the regular base model.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.360] So if you take a look at pricing,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.440] the regular iPhone 17 is a pretty decent value this year.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.360] You get 256 gigs of storage,
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.040] you get the new pro motion display,
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.000] you get a really improved front facing camera.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.080] Like this is a very solid package,
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.720] I think that Apple typically doesn't offer something
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.560] so good for $7.99, at least not in the past.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.960] The iPhone Air product, this is a separate conversation,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.200] this will have a separate video.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.240] I'm trying to make this work,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.920] but it's a whole conversation.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.080] The pro devices,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.640] so the value proposition when it comes to the pro devices
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.480] is always a little bit tricky.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.800] But this year, I feel like all the feature updates
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.000] and upgrades they've provided on this thing,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.160] awesome battery life, really good triple camera system
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.720] that's just very complete,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.200] plus all the thermal improvements
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.520] that give it just awesome overall performance.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.480] If you're into technology and you look at this
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.160] and you can't depreciate what's happening on this device,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.000] I don't want to say,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.720] this is a really solid offering from Apple.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.360] I think that when it comes to like Apple's pro devices,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.320] as much as they like to like blow smoke and hype things up,
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.640] I really think that this is an amazing year
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.240] for the pro devices, I really do.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.840] Okay, that's my take on these.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.400] Hope you guys enjoyed this video.
