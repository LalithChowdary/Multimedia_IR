[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360] I have eagerly been waiting for this laptop to come out because this has a very special
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.760] AMD chip in it.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.480] It's a chip that's been used in a few other laptops but none of them have done it right.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.040] They've either had weak GPUs or loud fans or screens capped at 120Hz so when Lenovo
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.920] announced their version of it, the Legion Pro 7, I was like, please be good and my goodness
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920] it is.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.400] This is paired with an RX5080 and a 1600 P OLED panel and this thing delivers the best
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400] performance.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.960] The highest frame rates, the fastest compile times for developers, the fastest render
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.320] times for 2D work, 3D work, this is the king.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.760] So I reached out to AMD and Lenovo and I was like, can you sponsor this video because I
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.640] want to show this thing to people early.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.800] This is something I think a lot of you guys are going to like.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.640] So the chip that is in here is the AMD Ryzen 9955 HX 3D.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.400] This chip is the most powerful laptop CPU.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.600] It's better than anything Intel has.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.400] In a lot of games we're looking at frame rates that are 10 to 15% faster.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.160] In some games it's way more than that and it's because this chip has something special.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.760] AMD's 3D Vcash and it's an extra layer of L3 cache that's stacked on top of the CPU
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.480] die and because of that extra L3 cache a lot of games and applications see noticeably
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.280] better performance on this chip.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960] So in addition to higher frame rate, you get more consistent frame rates which is really
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.040] valuable when it comes to competitor shooters.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.600] It's most noticeable at 1080p and 1440p resolutions but there are games in 4K as well.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.000] And for pro workflows you get faster compile times, you get faster render times.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.400] Almost every game and every application runs better with this chip.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.840] It's a combination of that 3D Vcash as well as that super high thread count.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.440] This has the highest thread count of any mobile chip right now.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.960] This particular laptop is running an RX5080 and at the time of shooting this I've reached
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960] out to load on.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.080] I was like is there a 5090 version and supposedly they went with the 5080 to launch with because
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.480] they're saying that's what people are buying.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.640] And they did say though that if there is demand for the 5090 that they will likely push
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.960] that out in the future.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.200] But apparently this is the stuff that sells.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.840] So the Legion Pro 7 is a full aluminum build.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.000] This is consistently one of the best built and just most appropriately priced gaming laptops
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520] you can get on the market.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.520] Very well respected by reviewers and enthusiasts alike.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.560] And the cooling system this year is very well done.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.600] It uses their Legion cold front tech but this one has a triple fan setup and a vapor
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600] chamber.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.280] So the left and right fan focus on cooling the CPU and GPU.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.640] But the third fan focuses on cooling that hyper chamber that we've seen on the past few
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.000] generations of high end Legion devices.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720] And you get good temperatures with good fan noise.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.880] And that is the strength of the whole Legion lineup right now.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.760] I think a lot of companies can cool laptop properly well.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.480] But to do it quietly is a whole separate conversation.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.480] And I think that's why so many reviewers like what they've been doing.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.920] Legion's been doing.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.400] It's just they do it quietly.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.800] Like that's the difficult thing to do nowadays.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.960] Now the measurements were done with a 5080.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.400] That caps at 175 watts.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.560] I imagine if you have the 5070 Ti lower wattage lower heat the numbers will be even lower.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.200] But I just think that this chassis can easily handle an RTX 5090.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.640] So if slash when they do release this product with the 5090 I imagine the thermals would
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.840] be fine on it.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.120] So the ports there are three USB A two USB C there's an Ethernet HDMI and they're all
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120] on the sides.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.480] There are no more rear mounted ports on Legion Pro 7 and seemingly it was all for thermal design.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.480] The idea being that when you have 100 watts CPU and 175 watt GPU and you're trying to
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.080] cool the 275 watts all together at once.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.560] It's very difficult or impossible to do when you've closed off most of the back to have
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.560] his ports.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.960] I will say I don't think that old chassis design as beautiful as it was.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.200] I don't think it could have cooled 275 not at this noise level.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.120] Now one thing to note all the USB ports are USB 3.2.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480] There is no USB 4 or Thunderbolt connectivity on the laptop.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.560] Alright the screen this is an awesome screen.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.960] It's the Lenovo PureSight OLED 16 inches 2560 by 1600.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.560] Wicked fast the 240Hz 0.08 millisecond response time.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.600] This screen is incredibly good for fast paced games.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.440] There's no ghosting and you get super vibrant colors against really deep blacks.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.480] It's really bright and it's color calibrated out of the factory.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.120] This is such a good screen.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.880] It doesn't get your classic Legion 7 keyboard.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.280] This is very comfortable to type on.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.280] I've always been fast on the Legion keyboards and also has a glass trackpad and all the lighting
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.240] and controls you would come to expect.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.160] It also has the fan profile hotkeys like you can just switch between them really quickly.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.440] I do wish that more companies would do stuff like that.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.760] So you just have very responsive and fast switching between the fan profiles with just short
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.480] cuts on the keyboard.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.720] Okay this has a battery life that is mixed.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.760] It has a big battery, the max size 99.9 watt hours and when this device is under load it
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.360] has a respectable battery life.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.320] It's comparable to any high performance laptop right now but the idle and light use battery
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.720] life is not great.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.960] It's long enough for watching a movie or something but this AMD chip is just not efficient
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.360] when it comes to idling or doing really light tasks.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.800] If you look at the inside you also see access to the two RAM slots, the two NVMe drive slots
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800] and your Wi-Fi 7 chip.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.080] Now this product starts at $22.80 USD for the base and if you want to get the 3D Vcash
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.840] it's a little bit more and hopefully the RTX 5090 configurations come soon for the people
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.160] that are willing to pay for it.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.880] But the way that I look at it is that if you care about high end performance like if you
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.640] use this for work and you really want that you know multi threaded workflow performance
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.160] and just the even for games it's just so many benefits that come with that extra 3D Vcash.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.560] This is just the better product aside from that shorter battery life when it comes to
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.560] just idling around.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.280] But if you're plugged up and you just want mobile performance this is it.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.080] This is such a good product this year.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.040] Okay there you have it the Legion Pro 7.
