Virtu is a fascinating brand. Because unlike every other luxury phone company who just takes an iPhone and covers it in gold, this is its own piece of tech designed for the ballers of the world. And it seems super legit. It's a British brand that was started by Nokia. Their official social media accounts hit hundreds of millions of real views.",
